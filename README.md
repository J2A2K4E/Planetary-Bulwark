“Planetary Bulwark: Invader Siege.” It’s a playable prototype scaffold you can run locally, featuring:

Three.js 3D rendering with instanced meshes for performance
Procedural terrain via noise-based heightmap
Dynamic voxel-grid pathfinding (A*), with live updates when placing structures
Basic RTS systems: resources, building placement, construction queues, waves
Simple tech tree and orbital abilities framework
Responsive HTML/CSS UI overlay
Node.js/Express backend for persistence, session, and telemetry
Notes:

This is a foundation to expand. It focuses on architecture, clean separation, and performance-conscious patterns.
No external images are used. All assets are programmatically generated.
The backend uses in-memory storage for simplicity; you can swap to a database later.
To run:
Save files as indicated (file tree below).
Run: npm install
Run: npm run dev
Open: http://localhost:3000
Extending this prototype:

Switch to a navmesh: Replace grid A* with Recast/Detour or triangulated navmesh and dynamic obstacle modifiers.
Procedural richness: Add biomes, craters, crags, and scattering via instanced foliage/rocks.
Performance: Use GPU-based culling, LOD terrain tiles, and frustum/occlusion pruning for projectiles and enemies.
Gameplay depth: Add construction time, repair units, line power networks, adjacency bonuses, enemy types, bosses, and multi-target turrets.
Backend: Persist saves to a database, add auth, and expand WebSocket sync for coop base defense.
Debugging tips:

Toggle a “path debug” overlay by coloring minimap cells by traversal cost and blocked status.
Log A* expansions per frame; cap re-path frequency per enemy to prevent spikes.
Profile instancing counts, and clamp projectile count.
Verify blockedHook returns correct occupancy when structures are added/removed.
Have fun building your planetary stronghold!
